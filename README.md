# RBXRebuilder
This program allows easy patching of ROBLOX clients provided you use patch files.

Documentation for these patch files is located @ https://github.com/Modnark/RBXRB-Patch-files/wiki/Patch-file-format

# Future plans
* Patch file creator (within the program itself), will allow you to make patch files easily
* Convert memory offsets to file offsets to reduce the amount of steps to create patch files
